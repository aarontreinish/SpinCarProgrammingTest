This project was for the SpinCar take home coding assignment. 

When you first launch the app you are promted with two textFields, one for the item you want to search and the other for the maximum number of images you'd like to return. This is hooked up to the Bing Image Search API. 

Put in whatever you want to search in the first textField and in the second put in the maximum number of images you would like, except it must be a prime number. Once you do that the press the enter button and the images will load and display on your screen in a tableView.
